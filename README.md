This project aims to create a simple shooting game that the player controls an automatically attacking character while fighting against enemies chasing your character.
<br>
<br>
Move your character by WASD on qwerty keyboard, and the position of the mouse determines the direction of the attack. Upgrade your character when you eliminates certain enemies. You can save your score and check ranking.
